        <p>Rule of thirds is about how elements on the page are aligned. The idea is that if you split an image into thirds, the human eye
            likes looking at the points where the thirds would intersect. The human brain also likes it when a major item 
            take up 2/3rds of the view area. As seen here, youtube has the video thumbnail take up the left 2/3rds, causing the eye to look at the 
            thumbnail first.

        <p>Repetition is the idea of repeating the same layout throughout diffrent pages of the website
            to give a cohesive experience to the user. Sufficient Velocity uses the same heading and footer for every page, along with a consistent
            style so every page feels like they belong together.

        <img src="images/itchio.PNG" alt="itch.io">
        <p>White space is the idea of having empty space between elements on a page. This is in order to prevent the page from 
            getting too crowded for a viewer to comprehend. Itch.io uses whitespace to help seperate items from eachother, with small amounts
            of whitespace used when items are grouped together, and larger amounts of whitespace when transitioning to a diffrent group.
